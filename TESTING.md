Desktop Test Path checks:

- Verify the visible app version is `1.1.0-beta.5`.
- Verify the desktop bundle path is `release/mac/Poster Lab Pro.app`.
- Verify Collab image prompt validation fails when `collabCharacter` is missing instead of reusing BOSS/prop assets as a partner.

- Verify Collab prompt package validation passes with `[Game Character]`, `[Collab Partner]`, and `[Game Logo]` bindings.
- Completed low-cost Collab real-generation rerun `job-collab-project-pizza-kitchen-beta5-collab-star-cream-mpwv1j6s`: accepted because the game character and synthetic partner stayed separate, interacted in one restaurant scene, and did not become a hybrid character.
- Verify the missing partner `brandLogo` audit remains `review` with `collab-missing-partner-brand-logo` and `collab-blank-partner-brand-plate`.
- Verify the image uses a blank partner brand plate or neutral partner area instead of fake readable partner branding.

Automated checks:

- Run `npm run workbench-live-gate-ui:check`.
- Run `npm run provider-credential-ui:check`.
- Run `npm run frontend-binding:check`.
- Run `npm run check` before packaging.

## 2026-06-02 1.0 Beta Multi-Mode Validation Update

Desktop Test Path checks:

- Verify `npm run check` passes after prompt, provider, storage, and UX changes.
- Verify `npm run prompts:check`, `npm run provider-requests:check`, `npm run google-live-adapter:check`, and `npm run openai-live-adapter:check` preserve shared asset fusion rules.
- Verify `npm run storage:check`, `npm run workspace-data:check`, and `npm run workspace-state:check` preserve workspace summary freshness after assets, queue jobs, results, and archive rows change.
- Verify the visible app version is `1.0.0-beta.2`.

Manual multi-mode live checks:

- Icon: one low-cost run; accept only `1:1`, no text, single strong subject, and 64px readability.
- Logo: one low-cost run; accept only wordmark/mark-first output with no BOSS or unrelated prop pollution.
- Announcement: one low-cost run; accept only a clear copy-safe area and no generated gibberish.
- Collab: one low-cost run; accept only two separated parties in a shared scene, not a merged hybrid.
- Do not add these live provider calls to automated checks because they can spend provider credits.

Known beta watch items:

- Image models may still prefer rounded app-icon masks in Icon mode; keep this as a manual review item until an icon-specific crop/background post-process is added.
- Complex generated text can still drift; prefer copy-safe regions or post-production text refinement over forcing unreadable AI text.
- If local network routing requires a proxy, run the dev server with the same proxy environment as the desktop shell.

## 2026-05-28 Generation Flow Rule Update

Poster generation checks:

- Verify the left control-panel batch action creates brief/scheme tasks only and no image-generation tasks.
- Verify the top-right Generate Poster action and scheme-card Render Image action continue from ready schemes and create image tasks.

- Verify scheme card copy-hidden and copy-visible states do not overlap image previews, variant buttons, or render buttons.
- Verify poster mode can create new schemes with no uploaded assets.
- Verify `styleReference`, `compositionReference`, and `gameLogo` are optional for poster batches and only strengthen the prompt when present.
- Verify the slogan language control stores exactly one selected language, defaulting to English.
- Verify provider brief requests send exactly one `languageTargets` entry and generated schemes keep slogans for that language only.
- Verify multiple uploaded `gameCharacter` assets are described as independent characters, not alternate looks for one character.
- Verify failed image tasks expose a one-click retry-all action that retries failed image tasks without rerunning the brief stage.
- Verify size stabilization keeps provider-native dimensions when exact, applies local resize only for close aspect-ratio matches, and records post-processing metadata.
- Verify queue checks allow the intentionally removed bottom task chrome while still validating queue contracts and runtime feedback.

Real provider tests remain manual and opt-in because image calls can spend provider credits. Automated checks should prefer fake transports and stored snapshots.

## 2026-05-24 Electron Desktop Shell Testing Update

Electron Desktop Shell checks:

- Verify `electron/main.cjs` opens the local Next workbench through a native `BrowserWindow`.
- Verify the shell reuses an existing Next service or starts `next dev` on a local port.
- Verify proxy-related environment variables are preserved for manual provider connection tests.
- Verify Electron main/preload code does not call provider APIs, read API Keys, or use browser credential storage.
- Verify packaged installer checks remain separate from the fast desktop dev shell.

Real live provider execution remains manual and opt-in from inside the workbench UI.

## 2026-05-24 Electron Packaging Testing Update

Electron Packaging checks:

- Verify `next.config.mjs` uses standalone output for the packaged desktop server.
- Verify `npm run desktop:pack` prepares `.next/standalone`, copies `.next/static` and `public`, and builds a portable unpacked Windows app.
- Verify `electron/main.cjs` starts the packaged standalone server with `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` when running from a packaged app.
- Verify `release/win-unpacked/Poster Lab Pro.exe` opens without a manually started Next dev server.

The packaged path is still local MVP testing, not a signed installer or production distribution flow.

## 2026-05-23 OpenAI-Compatible And Google Provider Testing Update

Provider setup checks:

- Verify provider settings can save API Key, Base URL, and default model without exposing clear-text keys in workspace snapshots.

- Verify Google connection diagnostics call the Gemini model-list endpoint with API-key authentication and user-safe errors.
- Verify Google image generation maps Gemini `inlineData` image parts to persisted result files.
- Verify manual live tests for Google use the same safety gate, encrypted credential vault, queue worker, and result storage path as OpenAI.
- Verify default automated checks use fake transports and never call real OpenAI, relay, or Google endpoints.

Real provider tests remain manual and opt-in because they can spend provider credits and depend on account/model availability.

## 2026-05-23 Persisted Result File Download Testing Update

Persisted result download checks:

- Verify `localFile` descriptors expose a safe app-local download URL when returned from the route.
- Verify descriptor JSON remains the default route response.

- Verify missing or non-local result sources return user-safe errors without provider calls.
- Verify the route does not read API Keys, environment fallback credentials, browser storage, or remote provider URLs.

Cloud storage, signed URLs, bulk export archives, provider URL ingestion, and retention cleanup remain later checks.

## 2026-05-23 Desktop Live Test Control Surface Update

Desktop live test control checks:

- Verify the live test button is disabled until HTTP mode, an OpenAI-compatible or Google provider, saved credential readiness, and an allowed live gate are present.
- Verify clicking the button can auto-prepare the local queue job, refresh credential status, and run the provider connection diagnostic before calling `/queue-plans/:jobId/live-test`.
- Verify clicking the button posts only to `/queue-plans/:jobId/live-test` and never calls provider APIs directly from the browser.
- Verify the request body includes explicit enablement, safety confirmations, accepted cost cap, and trace id.
- Verify successful route envelopes update manual test status and refresh the workspace snapshot.
- Verify blocked/error envelopes are shown in the task drawer without exposing clear-text API Keys or raw image payloads.
- Verify responsive viewports `1440`, `1024`, `768`, and `375px` do not overlap or overflow after the new control is visible.

Real live provider execution remains manual and opt-in; automated UI checks should use fake route envelopes or blocked states.

## 2026-05-23 Manual Desktop Live Generation Test Update

Manual live generation test checks:

- Verify the route blocks unless live execution is explicitly enabled and all cost/external-provider/result-storage confirmations are present.
- Verify the route resolves the saved credential only through the encrypted vault and never echoes the clear-text API Key.
- Verify the route reruns a provider connection diagnostic and blocks image generation when the diagnostic is not ready.
- Verify fake transports can complete the OpenAI live queue path and persist result files.
- Verify workspace snapshots contain result file metadata, not raw provider `dataUrl` payloads or clear-text credentials.
- Verify default automated checks use fake provider transports and do not call real provider APIs.

Real live generation remains manual and opt-in because it can spend provider credits and create local artifacts.

## 2026-05-23 Provider Connection Diagnostics Testing Update

Provider diagnostic checks:

- Verify connection tests resolve credentials through the encrypted vault and never echo clear-text API Keys.
- Verify missing saved credentials block before network probes.

- Verify default automated checks use fake transports and do not call live provider APIs.
- Verify the settings UI can show idle, testing, ready, unavailable, and failed connection states.

Real provider diagnostics are manual and opt-in because they require user credentials, network access, and provider account availability.

## 2026-05-23 Encrypted Provider Credential Vault Testing Update

Credential vault checks:

- Verify saving a provider API Key returns only masked status and a `secretStore` credential reference.
- Verify encrypted vault records do not contain the clear-text API Key.
- Verify resolving a valid credential ref returns the clear-text key only through `CredentialResolver`.
- Verify revoke clears the vault record and updates workspace provider status to masked/unconfigured.
- Verify credential routes do not call live providers, browser storage, or provider adapters.
- Verify workspace snapshots keep only `hasApiKey`, `apiKeyMasked`, provider status, model, and base URL.

OS keychain integration, cloud secret managers, team permission checks, browser autofill, and live provider quota tests remain separate tracks.

## 2026-05-23 Workbench Live Gate UI Testing Update

Workbench live gate UI checks:

- Verify the static workbench renders live gate status without calling provider APIs.
- Verify confirmation toggles update the visible gate state and blocker list.
- Verify cost cap values use monospace formatting and can block the gate when below estimated cost.
- Verify top toolbar, left Engine section, right inspector, and task drawer reference the same gate state.
- Verify responsive viewports `1440`, `1024`, `768`, and `375px` have no overlap or horizontal overflow.

Real provider UI execution remains disabled until a separate manual desktop live test path is approved.

## 2026-05-23 Live Execution Safety Gate Testing Update

Safety gate checks:

- Verify disabled live execution returns `skipped` and cannot call provider transport.
- Verify missing live-run, provider-cost, external-provider, or result-storage confirmations return structured blockers.

- Verify missing runtime credential, HTTP transport, or result file storage blocks execution.
- Verify allowed gate decisions can run OpenAI live queue through fake transport and persist result files.
- Verify blocker messages are user-safe and do not expose API keys or generated image bytes.

UI modal, real billing, production account limits, retry scheduling, and live provider quota tests remain manual/later.

## 2026-05-23 Explicit Live Queue Wiring Testing Update

Live queue wiring checks:

- Verify live queue execution skips unless an explicit live flag is provided.
- Verify missing runtime API key or missing HTTP transport blocks before provider adapter execution.
- Verify OpenAI image execution can run through a fake transport, runtime credential resolver, and injected provider registry.
- Verify returned `dataUrl` images are persisted through the result file store and snapshots record `resultFile` metadata.
- Verify persisted results do not keep raw provider `dataUrl` payloads in workspace metadata.
- Verify default queue worker checks still use mock providers and do not call live network APIs.

Real OpenAI queue execution remains manual/opt-in and should not be part of `npm run check` until product cost controls and UI confirmation are ready.

## 2026-05-22 Result File Storage Testing Update

Result file storage checks:

- Verify image `dataUrl` payloads decode to bytes and are written under workspace/result-scoped storage keys.
- Verify unsafe workspace ids, result ids, or filenames are sanitized and cannot escape the configured result root.
- Verify stored metadata includes mime type, byte size, checksum, storage key, and optional public URL.
- Verify result download descriptors prefer persisted local file metadata over transient provider metadata.
- Verify binary reads happen only in the explicit `?file=1` download route and only through the configured local result file store.
- Verify the file store does not call provider adapters, read environment variables, use browser storage, or perform network requests.

Cloud storage, signed URLs, provider URL fetching, retention cleanup, and bulk export packaging remain later.

## 2026-05-22 Runtime API Key Session Testing Update

Runtime credential checks:

- Verify creating a runtime session returns only a masked `ProviderCredentialRef`.
- Verify clear-text API keys do not appear in session DTOs, provider configs, or result summaries.
- Verify resolving a valid runtime ref supplies the key only through `CredentialResolver`.
- Verify expired, revoked, missing, and provider-mismatched refs return structured provider errors.
- Verify provider execution can consume the runtime resolver without changing mapped request or stored config contracts.
- Verify the runtime store does not call network APIs, read environment variables, write files, or use browser storage.

Encrypted credential vaults, team permission checks, browser autofill behavior, and persistent API Key settings remain separate test tracks.

Manual OpenAI smoke checks:

- Verify the command refuses to run unless explicit live opt-in is present.
- Verify missing runtime API key blocks before adapter execution.
- Verify fake success responses produce a redacted result summary without printing image bytes.
- Verify fake provider failures map to structured provider error summaries.
- Verify the safe checker does not perform real network calls, read environment variables, persist credentials, or save result files.

The real command is manual only. It should not be part of default CI/local checks and should only be run when the user accepts provider cost and has a disposable test prompt.

## 2026-05-22 OpenAI Image Adapter Testing Update

OpenAI adapter checks:

- Verify the adapter serializes image generation to `/images/generations` with explicit provider config and injected transport.

- Run `npm run check` before manual browser testing.
- Run `npm run poster-chain:check` to verify the first production path.
- Run `npm run build:next` before treating the route-backed workbench as locally testable.
- Launch `npm run dev:next` and inspect the workbench at the local Next URL.

Poster production chain checks:

- Verify a Poster workspace can create an image prompt package with required provider-ready assets.
- Verify the prompt maps to an image-generation provider request.
- Verify local API queue creation and queue run produce stored result records.
- Verify the first generated result resolves through the result download descriptor.
- Verify the chain remains mock-provider-backed and does not call live APIs, read environment variables, persist credentials, or write result files.

- Verify missing credentials return structured provider auth/config failures before adapter execution.
- Verify disabled live provider stubs return structured `provider_unavailable` through the harness.
- Verify the harness does not call network APIs, read environment variables, write files, use browser storage, or persist clear-text secrets.

Real provider smoke runs remain manual and opt-in until encrypted credentials, provider-specific fixtures, cost controls, and result storage are ready.

## 2026-05-22 Live Provider Adapter Stub Testing Update

Live adapter stub checks:

- Verify OpenAI, Replicate, ComfyUI, and Custom HTTP live adapter stubs can be registered through an explicit factory.
- Verify live stubs return structured `provider_unavailable` errors instead of fake success responses.

Actual live provider smoke tests remain opt-in and separate because they require credentials, quotas, network access, and provider-specific fixtures.

## 2026-05-22 Credential-Aware Queue Execution Testing Update

Queue/provider boundary checks:

- Verify workspace queue worker passes stored provider config through the credential-aware provider executor for image and post-processing tasks.
- Verify default mock queue execution can complete with in-memory mock credentials only.
- Verify missing credentials produce structured provider task failures before adapter execution.
- Verify result records preserve provider execution lineage metadata.
- Verify the default test path does not call live provider APIs, read environment variables, write credential files, or store clear-text secrets in workspace snapshots.

Live provider smoke tests remain opt-in later because they require real credentials, quotas, network stability, and persistent result storage.

## 2026-05-22 Submission Preflight Testing Update

Workbench submission checks:

- Verify normal static prototype submission still reaches `service-ready`.
- Verify frontend validation includes a `promptAssets` result.
- Verify missing required active-mode asset roles set submission status to `invalid`.
- Verify browser-only `blob:` previews on required assets set submission status to `invalid`.
- Verify invalid prompt assets skip prompt package creation, provider mapping, and queue planning service execution.

These checks are preflight-level only. Prompt/package contracts and provider request mapping remain the stricter downstream guards.

## 2026-05-22 Prompt Asset URL Testing Update

Prompt/provider asset checks:

- Verify prompt packages only bind assets relevant to the active production mode slots.
- Verify prompt asset bindings carry URL, mime type, storage key, and provider-readiness metadata.
- Verify image prompt validation reports missing required asset roles.
- Verify browser-only `blob:` previews are not treated as provider-safe URLs.
- Verify provider image requests include committed public asset URLs.
- Verify provider mapping rejects image generation when required asset references have no provider-safe URL.

These checks remain contract-level and mock-safe; live provider behavior, signed URLs, remote fetchability, and image preprocessing remain separate.

## 2026-05-22 Local Binary Asset Adapter Testing Update

Local binary upload checks:

- Verify `upload-binary` accepts multipart image files only after an upload plan exists in the client flow.
- Verify the uploaded file is written under `public/uploads/workspaces/:workspaceId/...`.
- Verify storage keys reject path traversal and unsafe absolute paths.
- Verify committed asset records prefer the returned local public URL over a browser `blob:` preview URL.
- Verify the browser asset route loop calls upload-plan, upload-binary, asset commit, asset list, and workspace reload in order.
- Verify the route stays local-only and does not call cloud storage, live providers, browser storage, or credential stores.

Production object storage, thumbnailing, permission checks, retention cleanup, and signed URLs remain separate test tracks.

## 2026-05-22 Real File Selection Metadata Testing Update

File intake checks:

- Verify `AssetsSection` exposes a hidden image file input and keeps slot/reference buttons as the visible triggers.
- Verify only `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, and `image/webp` are accepted.
- Verify selected `File` metadata is used for upload-plan payloads: file name, mime type, byte size, role, label, and client asset id.
- Verify local preview URLs are optional metadata only and not treated as persisted storage.
- Verify no binary upload, object storage SDK, provider execution, browser storage, or filesystem access is introduced.

Real binary upload tests remain separate and should cover upload URL transport, storage adapter behavior, thumbnail generation, and file cleanup.

## 2026-05-21 React Asset Section Boundary Testing Update

Asset section checks:

- Verify the static config panel exposes a React mount point and keeps a fallback for `02 Assets`.
- Verify `AssetsSection` renders asset slots, reference entry, and operation status from runtime metadata.
- Verify simulated asset upload still uses the existing metadata-only asset client.
- Verify asset operations can request a shell rerender after completion.
- Verify the React asset section does not open a file picker, read binary files, call providers, or introduce browser storage side effects.

Real upload tests remain separate because they require file input handling, object storage, thumbnailing, permissions, and binary transfer behavior.

## 2026-05-21 React Hook Form Brief And Direction Testing Update

Brief and direction checks:

- Verify the static config panel exposes React mount points and keeps fallbacks for brief and direction sections.
- Verify `BriefSection` uses React Hook Form, `zodResolver`, and `ProjectBriefFormSchema`.

- Verify project name, game description, and focus guidance write back to runtime form state.
- Verify mode-specific controls write back to runtime form state for poster, collab, announcement, and icon modes.
- Verify bound workspace snapshots carry edited brief and direction values into validation and queue payload preparation.
- Verify mounted React leaves do not introduce provider calls, browser storage, or upload side effects.

Browser viewport checks should continue for `1440`, `1024`, `768`, and `375px` after each section migration because static and React sections now coexist in the shell.

## 2026-05-21 React Hook Form Output Settings Testing Update

Output settings checks:

- Verify the static config panel exposes a React mount point and keeps a fallback for static preview.
- Verify the Next bridge mounts and unmounts React workbench leaves cleanly during shell rerenders.

- Verify platform presets, aspect ratios, images per scheme, and scheme count write back to runtime form state.
- Verify queue plan payloads continue to read edited output settings.
- Verify hidden static fallback controls do not become the Next-owned source of truth.

Browser viewport checks should continue for `1440`, `1024`, `768`, and `375px` after each section migration because static and React sections now coexist in the shell.

## 2026-05-21 Workbench Form Runtime Binding Testing Update

Workbench form binding checks:

- Verify visible left-panel controls expose schema-like `data-form-field` or `data-form-choice` paths.

- Verify bound workspace snapshots carry edited project brief, focus guidance, style tags, scheme count, and images-per-scheme.
- Verify form validation runs against edited runtime values.
- Verify queue plan payloads use edited output settings.
- Verify the static bridge remains separate from the future React Hook Form implementation while sharing field names and schema boundaries.

React Hook Form component tests should be added when individual panel sections are migrated from static HTML into React components.

- Verify the local API service exposes `runQueuePlan` through the workspace queue worker.
- Verify the Next run route delegates to `nextLocalApiService` and returns a standard envelope.
- Verify successful run/reload updates runtime workspace state with queue plans, queue summaries, results, and archive-ready data.
- Verify the task drawer and queue view model read runtime queue state before static fallback data.
- Verify no live providers, browser storage, filesystem writes, or scattered fetch calls are introduced.

Live provider queue tests remain separate because they need credentials, quotas, binary result storage, retry policy, cancellation policy, and worker deployment behavior.

Asset UI checks:

- Verify the left-panel asset actions call upload-plan, commit, asset-list, and workspace reload in order.
- Verify the asset route flow is metadata-only and does not read files or upload binaries.
- Verify HTTP mode updates runtime workspace state after asset commit.
- Verify static preview mode can simulate an asset commit without network calls.
- Verify fetch remains isolated to explicit data/client services, not render modules or event handlers.

Real upload tests must be added later when file input, object storage, thumbnailing, and permissions exist.

## 2026-05-21 Runtime Workspace Data Binding Testing Update

Workspace data binding checks:

- Verify the workbench has a dedicated HTTP workspace data service for `GET /api/workspaces/:workspaceId`.
- Verify the Next bridge loads a workspace snapshot after initial static render when running in HTTP mode.
- Verify the loaded snapshot replaces the default static snapshot in runtime state.
- Verify project, assets, providers, schemes, archive rows, and form DTO payloads read from runtime snapshot state.
- Verify fetch remains isolated to the workspace data service and submission HTTP client, not render or event modules.

This step does not require live providers, real uploads, polling, database hosting, or a React component rewrite.

## 2026-05-21 Frontend HTTP Submission Bridge Testing Update

Frontend HTTP bridge checks:

- Verify the static workbench still defaults to the no-network static service facade.
- Verify the Next bridge can opt into HTTP mode.
- Verify the HTTP client calls snapshot, prompt, provider request, and queue plan routes in order.
- Verify HTTP and static service flows return the same top-level step shape for task drawer rendering.

This step does not require live providers, real uploads, production database hosting, or a React component rewrite.

## 2026-05-21 Queue Worker And Result Writer Testing Update

Queue worker checks:

- Verify a workspace queue worker can load a snapshot, execute a queued plan through mock providers, and save the updated snapshot.

- Verify queue summaries reflect completed, failed, cost, progress, and elapsed state after execution.
- Verify archive rows are created from stored results without duplicating existing archive records.
- Verify the worker does not call live providers, cloud storage, browser storage, filesystem writes, or external network APIs by default.

Live worker tests must be opt-in later because they require credentials, provider quotas, binary result storage, retry timing, and background process orchestration.

## 2026-05-21 Provider Credential Boundary Testing Update

Provider credential checks:

- Verify workspace snapshots and database rows never contain clear-text provider API keys.

- Verify a credential-aware execution call can run through the mock registry after resolving a runtime secret.
- Verify default tests do not call live provider APIs, read environment variables, access browser storage, or write credential files.

Real provider smoke tests must remain separate and opt-in because they require live credentials, network access, quota handling, and provider-specific fixtures.

## 2026-05-21 Asset Upload And Library Testing Update

Asset boundary checks:

- Verify every production mode exposes required and optional asset slots.
- Verify upload metadata validation rejects unsupported mime types, unsafe names, and oversized files.

- Verify committing an asset writes a `StoredAssetRecord` into the workspace snapshot through `StorageRepository`.
- Verify listing assets supports role and usage filters.
- Verify the asset service and route handlers do not read local files, write binaries, call cloud storage, or fetch remote assets.

This remains metadata-only. Real upload, thumbnailing, image preprocessing, CDN delivery, and permissions require separate tests later.

## 2026-05-21 Database Persistence Testing Update

Database persistence checks:

- Verify the SQL schema includes workspace, asset, result, provider config, and archive tables.
- Verify database rows can be created from a redacted workspace snapshot.
